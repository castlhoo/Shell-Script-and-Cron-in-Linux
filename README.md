# Shell-Script-and-Cron-in-Linux üñ•Ô∏è

**Personal Project Overview**:  
This project is focused on enhancing my understanding of Shell programming through hands-on practice and automating tasks using Cron. I used Shell scripts to create files and directories within a virtual machine by utilizing `for` and `if` statements. Additionally, I set up Cron to automatically back up all files in the created directory every day at 9:00 AM.

## 1. Creating Directories Using Shell üìÇ

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Get directory name and the number of directories to create
echo "Enter the name of the directory to be created:"  
read dir_name

echo "Enter the number of directories to be created:"
read dir_number

# Check if the directory already exists, and if not, create it
for ((i=1; i<=dir_number; i++))
do
    dir="${dir_name}${i}"

    if [ -d "$dir_name" ]; then
        echo "Directory '$dir_name' already exists."
    else
        mkdir "$dir"
        echo "Directory '$dir' has been created."
    fi

done
exit 0
```

> First, the script receives the directory name and the number of directories to be created using `read`. A `for` loop is then used to iterate from 1 to the specified number. A new variable `dir` is generated by combining the input `dir_name` and the loop index `i`. The `if` statement checks whether the directory already exists, printing a message if it does or creating the directory if it doesn't.

## 2. Preparing for Backup ‚öôÔ∏è

To prepare for the backup, I wrote a shell script that performs the backup program.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define the source directory and backup location
SOURCE_DIR="/home/username/step02shell"
BACKUP_DIR="/home/username/step02shell_$(date +\%Y\%m\%d_\%H\%M\%S)"

# Create the backup directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

# Copy the directory for backup
cp -r "$SOURCE_DIR" "$BACKUP_DIR"

echo "Backup complete: $SOURCE_DIR -> $BACKUP_DIR"
```

> First, the source directory and backup location are defined, then the backup directory is created if it doesn't already exist.

> Afterward, execution permissions are assigned to the file, making the backup script executable.

## 3. Setting Up Cron ‚è∞

Cron is used to automate the backup process by editing the crontab with the following command:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add the following line to schedule the backup script to run every day at 9:00 AM:

```
0 9 * * * /path/to/backup_step02shell.sh
```

> This ensures the backup script runs automatically every day at 9:00 AM.

This project demonstrates how to create directories using Shell scripts and automate the backup of files using Cron.

Refactoring
I want to make the number of directories want to start creating. So I added it.
